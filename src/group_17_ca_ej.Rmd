#### Figure 1.

There appears to be an overall negative correlation between percentage of white Californians in the census and the CalEnviro Pollution Burden Score.  Density is highest in the 0-10% white and 75% values of the % White range, and the 50 and 10 values on the CalEnviro Pollution Burden Score range.
